A re-upload of the legendary 3ds emulator, which was taken down alongside yuzu due to the lawsuit they faced.

I can't upload a ton of files at the same time so I have set up a google drive link to the .tar.gz I've never used github IM SORRY so here's the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/12rK2r6wzEDieiI8T8Y1kNFRsMH1BiafK/view?usp=sharing

The other day I build citra from source. I didn't delete the source files I git cloned to that folder but if I needed space I can delete it if need be. My shocked ass when citra and yuzu are removed from the internet. I literally just made this github account just to reupload these files as fast as possible.

It's sad to see citra die. It was awesome to use this as a tool and even just to see how 3ds games look in HD. I've never used citra with roms that were not dumped by me.
I reuploaded this because I'm a fan, I AM NOT A DEV I WILL NEVER UPDATE THIS. I'm just reuploading it for the preservation of history.

# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS 
Note: Instead of git cloneing (Because the github page for citra was removed) use the .tar.gz because that IS the git clone I used to build citra
