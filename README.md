# Citra Re-upload. It will be missed. o7

A re-upload of the legendary 3ds emulator, which was taken down alongside yuzu due to the lawsuit they faced.

The google drive link is no longer nessesary, you can git clone straght from this github page. If you want the .tar.xz (for some reason )

The other day I build citra from source. I didn't delete the source files I git cloned to that folder but if I needed space I can delete it if need be. My shocked ass when citra and yuzu are removed from the internet. I literally just made this github account just to reupload these files as fast as possible.

It's sad to see citra die. It was awesome to use this as a tool and even just to see how 3ds games look in HD. I've never used citra with roms that were not dumped by me.
I reuploaded this because I'm a fan, I AM NOT A DEV I WILL NEVER UPDATE THIS. I'm just reuploading it for the preservation of history.
